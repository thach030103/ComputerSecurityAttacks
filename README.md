# [SEED Attack Labs](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/) 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you to set up the environment on your local machine to perform these attacks.

Step 1: Create a new VM in VMware Workstation Pro.\
Step 2: Download the image [SEEDUbuntu-16.04-32bit.zip](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) from here.\
Step 3: Use the Virtual Machine Hard Disk file to setup your VM.\
Step 4: Configure the VM.

## List of Attacks

1. **SQL injection Attack**
>*Description:* In this lab, we have created a web application that is vulnerable to the SQL injection attack. Our web application includes the common mistakes made by many web developers. Our goal is to find ways to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities, demonstrate the damage that can be achieved by the attack, and master the techniques that can help defend against such type of attacks.

2. **Cross Site Scripting Attack**
>*Description:* In this lab, we need to exploit this vulnerability to launch an XSS attack on the modified Elgg, in a way that is similar to what Samy Kamkar did to MySpace in 2005 through the notorious Samy worm. The ultimate goal of this attack is to spread an XSS worm among the users, such that whoever views an infected user profile will be infected, and whoever is infected will add you (i.e., the attacker) to his/her friend list.

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery Attack**
>*Description:* In this lab, we will be attacking a social networking web application using the CSRF attack. The open-source social networking application called Elgg has countermeasures against CSRF, but we have turned them off for this lab. We also study the most common countermeasures of this attack.
